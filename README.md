# The Lorenz Attractor
## Evaluating the Lorenz Attractor using Runge-Kutta, Predictor-Corrector and Euler methods. 

This repository is a college project of Numerical Differential Equations

A set of three coupled ordinary differential equations known as the Lorenz equations were evaluated using the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta, Adams-Bashfort-Moulton and Euler method to produce a solution known as the Lorenz Attractor. The parameters of the Lorenz attractor were systematically altered using a python program to ascertain their effect on the behaviour of the chaotic system and the possible physical consequences of these changes.
